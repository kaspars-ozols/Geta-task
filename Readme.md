<b>Geta Task 1</b>

  The main task when adapting the design for smaller devices is to keep the design simple but don't lose the features of the website.
Here are some suggestions for adapting the design for smaller devices that I come up with when I looked into the picture that was included in Task 1:

  * make the main content easy to read and understand - increase main content ratio versus sidebar;
  * change navigation-bar and side-bar from multiple menu options to single icon navigation (hamburger) with a drop-down menu list, so it makes it more user interactive on smaller devices;
  * adapt font size and style - usually use smaller font size for smaller devices and also it's recommended to use simpler font styles for smaller devices;
  * re-sizing image depending on device screen size;
  * adopt buttons so they can be easily clicked on and also make sure they are easy to recognize (stands out from the rest of the page).
